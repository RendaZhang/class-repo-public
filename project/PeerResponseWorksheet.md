## Peer Reflection of Doxygen Documentation

As the author of the documentation, please compile Doxygen and provide the html folder to your peer responder AND your UML document. You may provide it by posting it on the web (you all have a cselabs web page or you can use some other web server).

As you reflect on the author's writing, keep in mind the intended audience and purpose of the writing.
- AUDIENCE: A programmer joining the project team who has no familiarity with the project.
- PURPOSE: Provide sufficient information to this programmer to reduce her/his time and effort to be productive and contributing to the project.

Load index.html and read the mainpage text. Answer these questions corresponding to mainpage, considering that the audience would be a programmer unfamiliar with this project. The go:

  1. In the first paragraph of the mainpage, what is the most effective sentence with respect to orienting the reader to the project?

  2. Identify a sentence in the first paragraph that needs to be reworked and state what you think is problematic about that sentence. (Do not edit it.)

  3. Identify a sentence or two in any of the paragraphs that provides the "big picture" with respect to the software, design, or class structure, AND is accompanied by low-level details that help the reader better understand the "big picture."

  4. Comment on the effectiveness of this technique in the example from (3). If it is effective, analyze why you think it works here. If you think there are other details that would be more elucidating, state those.

  5. Identify a topic in the writing that is either underspecified or is discussed too in-depth. If underspecified, what is the most important idea that is missing? If too in-depth, what can be removed?

  6. What do you think would be the single most impactful change to this document - in other words, what would you recommend to the author as the one area on which to focus? It could be related to the content (e.g. level of detail, more or less technical information, highlight more or fewer classes, etc.) or to the writing (e.g. reorganize paragraph or sentence order, condense text, improve sentence structure, etc.).

  7. As a programmer new to this project, which class do you think the document is emphasizing as the place to begin to engage the code? This might be explicit or implicit. What part of the writing made you think you should start with that class?

  Now explore the documentation of the classes. Go to the class that you identified in (7).

  8. What do you consider to be the best and worst documented method in that class and why. OR, if you think they are all of equal quality, comment on the level of detail provided in the documentation. Is it sufficient, clear, and correct? If it is excellent, state what makes it excellent.

  9. Skim through all the brief comments on the main classes page. What strikes you as you look at the collection? Is there an effective pattern in the comments? Is there something consistently lacking?

  Now look at the UML - be conscious of your first reaction!

  10. Where did your eye go? What jumps out at you on the page? Is this an important element, thus warrants the attention? If not, offer a suggestion on how to make it less visually prominent.

  11. What did the author do in her/his UML diagram that you would like to incorporate into your UML? Why do you like that part of the UML and how does it differ from what you did?

  12. Try to recall your sense of your first attempt to engage the base code, and think of how it is even more complex now. Keeping that in mind, what do you think was the most successful part of the author's writing (in doxygen and UML) with respect to helping a programmer get acclimated to the code? What do you think could be very helpful but needs some rework?
