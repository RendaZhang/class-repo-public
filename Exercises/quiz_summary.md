## Summary of Quiz Questions

### Quiz 1
- What are the values of class members after a constructor is called. How do those get set?
- Initialization of a class is important. What are some ways that you can perform initialization?
- Identify compilation errors related to constructors, access to member variables, and calling class methods.
- Identify a place where classes are tightly coupled (bad) and suggest how to improve that.

### Quiz 2
- Determine which class method is called when calling through the base class (e.g. a Mallard is instantiated and placed in an array of Ducks, which is its base class, then a function is called on the array element). If it is implemented properly with polymorphism, the Mallard method will be called. If not, the Duck method will be called.
- What is the advantage of the strategy pattern over overriding a function?

### Quiz 3
- Given declarations of various variables, can you determine how much memory is allocated for that variable (e.g. Robot \* robot, Robot robots[n], or Robot \* robots[n])? Do you know how to declare objects and assign them to an array?
- Can you determine when values change and in what way when using pointers and references? What about when you change values in a helper function of a passed structure, class instance, or variable - will the passed object being permanently modified?
- What is the purpose of _const_ in conjunction with passing by reference?

### Quiz 4
- Argue the merits of a particular class hierarchy. Are you following the IS-A, HAS-A relationship? How might the class hierarchy impact the ease of modification? What about ease of implementation? Are the classes too tightly coupled?
- Create a new class within a given class hierarchy â€“ which class should it inherit from and why?

### Quiz 6
